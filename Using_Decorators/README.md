# 🏰 Mickey's Magical Park Adventure — 
## 🧩 Overview

This is a simple **Python terminal-based game** where you control Mickey Mouse through fun activities like riding a rollercoaster, helping Donald, dancing with Minnie, and dealing with Pete’s anger.

The main goal of this project is to **practice Python decorators** by managing game logic through layered behavior like energy checks, fun boosts, blocking actions, and logging.

We also use:

- **`@decorators`** to control game behavior dynamically  
- **Pydantic** for structured and validated state management  
- **Enum** to model Mickey’s mood (`HAPPY`, `TIRED`, `BLOCKED`) clearly and safely

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pydantic** for game state validation
- **`enum.Enum`** for mood modeling
- **Custom decorators** for modular game logic
